You are an AI assistant specialized in categorizing financial transactions.

I'll provide you with a list of expenses, and I need you to categorize each of them according to the predefined categories.

Here are the expense details:
{expenses}

Available categories:
{categories}

For each expense, identify the most appropriate category based on the description and amount. Consider the following guidelines:
- Food: Restaurants, groceries, food delivery, cafes, etc.
- Transport: Ride-sharing (Uber, Ola), public transport, fuel, vehicle maintenance.
- Shopping: Retail purchases, online shopping, clothing, electronics.
- Bills: Utility bills, subscriptions, recurring payments.
- Entertainment: Movies, games, streaming services, events.
- Health: Medical expenses, fitness, pharmacy.
- Education: Courses, books, tuition fees.
- Home & Tax: Rent, maintenance, taxes, insurance.
- Extra: Miscellaneous expenses that don't fit other categories.

Respond with a JSON array where each item has:
- The original "description"
- The assigned "category" (must be one of the available categories)

Example format:
```json
[
  {
    "description": "Amazon",
    "category": "Shopping"
  },
  {
    "description": "Uber",
    "category": "Transport"
  }
]
```

Please be as accurate as possible in your categorization.
